    <h1>Welcome to BBlog!</h1>
    <p>There probably will not be a lot of original materials here, mostly I need a better way to store reference information and store reminders and links to resources that will be useful in the  *future*  (definition of Future: that nebulous time in which I will have copious amounts of free time to peruse the content included here and learn until my head explodes), as creating a bookmark everytime I find something worth saving just doesn't "scale". Also I need to work on avoiding run-on sentences.</p>
    <h2>Categories</h2>
      <p>This is where I shall form categories to organize the mass of information.</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="#">link to a category</a></li>
	<pli>another arbitrary category</li>
	<li>Another... Wait screw it, for now this site is going to be in a state of glorious disarray!!</li>
      </ul>
