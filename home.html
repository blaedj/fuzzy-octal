    <h1><strong>Welcome to BBlog!</strong></h1>
      <p>There probably will not be a lot of original materials here, mostly I need a better way to store reference information and store reminders and links to resources that will be useful in the *future*(definition of Future: that nebulous time in which I will have copious amounts of free time to peruse the content included here and learn until my head explodes), as creating a bookmark everytime I find something worth saving just doesn't *scale*. Also I need to work on avoiding run-on sentences.</p>
    <h2>Categories</h2>
      <p>This is where I shall form categories to organie</p>
      <ul>
	<li>a random list item</li>
	<li>another list item</li>
      </ul>
